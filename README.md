# Aspartate_Racemase_Ligands_Bioactivity_Prediction
 This scripts tries to predict the bioactivity of 131 small molecule compounds (taken from ChEMBL) related to Aspartate Racemase enzyme with the aid of MACCS166 Chemical Fingerprints (from *Rcpi* package) and the Decision Tree algorithm (from *rpart* package).
